# Lab Repository

Welcome to my "Lab" repository! This is a collection of scripts, configurations, and files I've created or used for various projects and experiments. The focus is on learning, testing, and sharing useful tools or techniques.

## Structure

The repository is organized into sections based on topic or technology. Here's an overview:

- **Kubernetes**: Contains YAML configurations for my homelab setup, including deployments, services, and more.
- **PowerShell**: Scripts from various projects, including a privilege escalation script I developed for a hackathon.
- Other topics may be added in the future as the repository evolves.

Each directory may include files specific to its topic. For detailed instructions, check the individual directories or the files themselves.
